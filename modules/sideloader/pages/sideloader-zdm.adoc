:description: Use {sstable-sideloader} to migrate data with {product-short}.

{sstable-sideloader} is a service running in {astra-db} that directly imports data from snapshot backups that you've uploaded to {astra-db} from an existing {dse-short}, {hcd-short}, or other compatible {cass-short} cluster.
For compatible origin clusters, see xref:ROOT:astra-migration-paths.adoc[].

Because it imports data directly, {sstable-sideloader} can offer several advantages over CQL-based tools like {dsbulk-migrator} and {cass-migrator}, including faster, more cost-effective data loading, and minimal performance impacts on your origin cluster and target database.

{sstable-sideloader} uses the {astra} {devops-api}, your cloud provider's CLI, and `nodetool`.
