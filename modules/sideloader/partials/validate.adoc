After the migration is complete, you can query the migrated data using the xref:astra-db-serverless:cql:develop-with-cql.adoc#connect-to-the-cql-shell[{cql-shell}] (`cqlsh`) or xref:astra-db-serverless:api-reference:row-methods/find-many.adoc[{data-api}].

You can xref:ROOT:cassandra-data-migrator.adoc#cdm-validation-steps[run {cass-migrator-short} in validation mode] for more thorough validation.
{cass-migrator-short} also offers an AutoCorrect mode to reconcile any differences that it detects.
