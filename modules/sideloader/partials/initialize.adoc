After you create snapshots on the origin cluster and pre-configure the schema on the target database, use the {astra} {devops-api} to initialize the migration.

.{sstable-sideloader} moves data from the migration bucket to {astra-db}.

When you initialize a migration, {sstable-sideloader} does the following:

. Creates a secure migration bucket.
+
The migration bucket is only created during the first initialization.
All subsequent migrations use different directories in the same migration bucket.
+
{company} owns the migration bucket, and it is located within the {astra} perimeter.

. Generates a migration ID that is unique to the new migration.

. Creates a migration directory within the migration bucket that is unique to the new migration.
+
The migration directory is also referred to as the `uploadBucketDir`.
In the next phase of the migration process, you will upload your snapshots to this migration directory.

. Generates upload credentials that grant read/write access to the migration directory.
+
The credentials are formatted according to the cloud provider where your target database is deployed.
