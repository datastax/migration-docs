You can use {product-proxy} to support migrations from {cass-reg}, {dse}, {hcd}, {astra-db}, and other {cass-short}-based databases to any other {cass-short}-based database of the equivalent type or version:

Compatible origin clusters::
Migrate from one of the following:
+
* {dse} version 4.7.1 and later
* {cass-reg} version 2.1.6 and later
* Other {cass-short}-based databases that are based on a compatible {cass-short} version, such as {astra-db} Classic, ScyllaDB, and Yugabyte.

Compatible target clusters::
Migrate to one of the following:
+
* {hcd}
* A cluster running the same or later version of {cass-short} or {dse-short}
* {astra-db}
+
