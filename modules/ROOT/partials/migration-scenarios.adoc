You can use {product-proxy} to support migrations from {cass-reg}, {dse}, {hcd}, {astra-db}, and other {cass-short}-based databases to any other {cass-short}-based database of the equivalent type or version:

Compatible origin clusters::
Migrate from one of the following:
+
* https://www.datastax.com/products/datastax-enterprise[{dse}] version 4.7.1 and later
* https://cassandra.apache.org/_/index.html[{cass-reg}] version 2.1.6 and later
* Other {cass-short}-based databases that are based on a compatible {cass-short} version, such as {astra-db} Classic, ScyllaDB, and Yugabyte.

Compatible target clusters::
Migrate to one of the following:
+
* https://www.datastax.com/products/hyper-converged-database-hcd[{hcd}]
* A cluster running the same or later version of {cass-short} or {dse-short}
* https://www.datastax.com/products/datastax-astra[{astra-db}]
