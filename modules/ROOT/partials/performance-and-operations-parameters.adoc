Performance and operations parameters that can affect migration throughput, error handling, and similar concerns.

|Property | Default | Notes

| `spark.cdm.perfops.numParts`
| `10000`
| In standard operation, the full token range of -2^63 to 2^63-1 is divided into a number of parts, which are parallel processed.
You should aim for each part to comprise a total of â‰ˆ1-10GB of data to migrate.
During initial testing, you may want this to be a small number, such as `1`.

| `spark.cdm.perfops.batchSize`
| `5`
| When writing to the target cluster, this comprises the number of records that are put into an `UNLOGGED` batch.
{cstar-data-migrator} tends to work on the same partition at a time.
If your partition sizes are larger, this number may be increased.
If the `spark.cdm.perfops.batchSize` would mean that more than 1 partition is often contained in a batch, reduce this parameter's value.
Ideally < 1% of batches have more than 1 partition.

| `spark.cdm.perfops.ratelimit.origin`
| `20000`
| Concurrent number of operations across all parallel threads from the origin cluster.
This value may be adjusted up or down, depending on the amount of data and the processing capacity of the origin cluster.

| `spark.cdm.perfops.ratelimit.target` 
| `40000`
| Concurrent number of operations across all parallel threads from the target cluster.
This may be adjusted up or down, depending on the amount of data and the processing capacity of the target cluster.

| `spark.cdm.perfops.consistency.read`
| `LOCAL_QUORUM`
| Commented out.
Read consistency from the origin cluster and from the target cluster when records are read for comparison purposes.
The consistency parameters may be one of: `ANY`, `ONE`, `TWO`, `THREE`, `QUORUM`, `LOCAL_ONE`, `EACH_QUORUM`, `LOCAL_QUORUM`, `SERIAL`, `LOCAL_SERIAL`, `ALL`.

| `spark.cdm.perfops.consistency.write`
| `LOCAL_QUORUM`
| Commented out.
Write consistency to the target cluster.
The consistency parameters may be one of: `ANY`, `ONE`, `TWO`, `THREE`, `QUORUM`, `LOCAL_ONE`, `EACH_QUORUM`, `LOCAL_QUORUM`, `SERIAL`, `LOCAL_SERIAL`, `ALL`.

| `spark.cdm.perfops.printStatsAfter`
| `100000`
| Commented out.
Number of rows of processing after which a progress log entry is made.

| `spark.cdm.perfops.fetchSizeInRows`
| `1000`
| Commented out.
This parameter affects the frequency of reads from the origin cluster and the frequency of flushes to the target cluster. 

| `spark.cdm.perfops.errorLimit`
| `0`
| Commented out.
Controls how many errors a thread may encounter during `MigrateData` and `DiffData` operations before failing.
Recommendation: set this parameter to a non-zero value **only when not doing** a mutation-type operation, such as when you're running `DiffData` without `.autocorrect`.
