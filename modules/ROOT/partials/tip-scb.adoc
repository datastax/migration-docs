. Click on **Connect**.
. Select the **Java driver**, choosing the driver based on the CQL APIs.
. Click on **Download bundle** (choosing a region if prompted to do so).

For more information on the SCB and how to retrieve it, see https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra/astra-db-vector/drivers/secure-connect-bundle.html[the {astra-db-serverless} documentation].
