{product} provides a simple and reliable way for you to migrate applications from any CQL-based cluster (https://cassandra.apache.org/_/index.html[{cass-reg}], https://www.datastax.com/products/datastax-enterprise[{dse}], https://www.datastax.com/products/datastax-astra[{astra-db}], or any type of CQL-based database) to any other CQL-based cluster, without any interruption of service to the client applications and data.

* You can move your application to {astra-db}, {dse-short}, or {cass-short} with no downtime and with minimal configuration changes.
* Your clusters are kept in sync at all times by a dual-write logic configuration.
* You can xref:rollback.adoc[roll back] at any point, for complete peace of mind.

[TIP]
====
The {product} process requires you to be able to perform rolling restarts of your client applications during the migration.

This is standard practice for client applications that are deployed over multiple instances and is a widely used approach to roll out releases and configuration changes.

== Migration scenarios

include::partial$migration-scenarios.adoc[]

[TIP]
====
An important migration prerequisite is that you already have the matching schema on Target.
A CQL statement that your client application sends to {product-proxy} must be able to succeed on both Origin and Target clusters.
This means that any keyspace that your client application uses must exist on both Origin and Target with the same name.
Table names must also match.
For more, see xref:feasibility-checklists.adoc#_schemakeyspace_compatibility[Schema/keyspace compatibility].

== Migration phases

First, a couple of key terms used throughout the {product-short} documentation and software components:

* **Origin:** This cluster is your existing {cass-short}-based environment, whether it's {cass}, {dse-short}, or {astra-db}.

* **Target:** This cluster is the new environment to which you want to migrate client applications and data.

=== Migration diagram

Discover the migration concepts, software components, and sequence of operations.

Your migration project occurs through a sequence of phases, which matches the structure of the {product} documentation.

The highlighted components in each phase emphasize how your client applications perform read and write operations on  your Origin and Target clusters.

==== Pre-migration client application operations

Here's a look at a pre-migration from a high-level view.
At this point, your client applications are performing read/write operations with an existing CQL-compatible database such as {cass}, {dse-short}, or {astra-db}.

'''

==== Phase 1: Deploy {product-proxy} and connect client applications

In this first phase, deploy the {product-proxy} instances and connect client applications to the proxies.
This phase activates the dual-write logic.
Writes are bifurcated (sent to both Origin and Target), while reads are executed on Origin only.

'''

==== Phase 2: Migrate data

In this phase, migrate existing data using {cass-migrator} or {dsbulk-loader}.
Validate that the migrated data is correct, while continuing to perform dual writes.

'''

==== Phase 3: Enable asynchronous dual reads

In this phase, you can optionally enable asynchronous dual reads.
The idea is to test performance and verify that Target can handle your application's live request load before cutting over from Origin to Target.

'''

==== Phase 4: Route reads to Target

In this phase, read routing on the {product-proxy} is switched to Target so that all reads are executed on it, while writes are still sent to both clusters.
In other words, Target becomes the primary cluster.

'''

==== Phase 5: Connect directly to Target

In this phase, move your client applications off the {product-proxy} and connect the apps directly to Target.
Once that happens, the migration is complete.

== A fun way to learn: {product} Interactive Lab

include::partial$interactive-lab.adoc[]

The interactive lab spans the pre-migration prerequisites and each of the five key migration phases illustrated above.
