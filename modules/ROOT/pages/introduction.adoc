{product} provides a simple and reliable way for you to migrate applications from a CQL-based cluster to another CQL-based cluster with little or no downtime and minimal interruption of service to your client applications and data.

include::ROOT:partial$supported-releases.adoc[]

{product-short} keeps your clusters in sync at all times by a dual-write logic configuration, and you can xref:rollback.adoc[roll back] at any point.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* True zero downtime migration is only possible if your database meets the xref:ROOT:feasibility-checklists.adoc[minimum requirements].
If your database doesn't meet these requirements, you can still complete the migration, but downtime might be necessary to finish the migration.

* The {product} process requires you to be able to perform rolling restarts of your client applications during the migration.
This is standard practice for client applications that are deployed over multiple instances, and it is a widely used approach to roll out releases and configuration changes.

== Migration phases

A migration project includes preparation for the migration and five migration phases.

The following sections describe the major events in each phase and how your client applications perform read and write operations on your origin and target clusters during each phase.

The _origin_ is is your existing {cass-short}-based environment, which can be {cass}, {dse-short}, or {astra-db}.
The _target_ is your new {cass-short}-based environment where you want to migrate your data and client applications.

=== Pre-migration client application operations

Here's a look at a pre-migration from a high-level view.
At this point, your client applications are performing read/write operations with an existing CQL-compatible database such as {cass}, {dse-short}, or {astra-db}.

[TIP]
====
For the migration to succeed, the origin and target clusters must have matching schemas.

A CQL statement that your client application sends to {product-proxy} must be able to succeed on both the origin and target clusters.

This means that any keyspace that your client application uses must exist on both the origin and target clusters with the same name.
The table names, column names, and data types must also match.
For more information, see xref:feasibility-checklists.adoc#_schemakeyspace_compatibility[Schema/keyspace compatibility].

=== Phase 1: Deploy {product-proxy} and connect client applications

In this first phase, deploy the {product-proxy} instances and connect client applications to the proxies.
This phase activates the dual-write logic.
Writes are bifurcated (sent to both the origin and target), while reads are executed on the origin only.

=== Phase 2: Migrate data

In this phase, migrate existing data using {cass-migrator} or {dsbulk-loader}.
Validate that the migrated data is correct, while continuing to perform dual writes.

=== Phase 3: Enable asynchronous dual reads

In this phase, you can optionally enable asynchronous dual reads.
The idea is to test performance and verify that the target cluster can handle your application's live request load before cutting over from the origin to the target permanently.

=== Phase 4: Route reads to the target cluster

In this phase, read routing on the {product-proxy} is switched to teh target cluster so that all reads are executed on the target.
Writes are still sent to both clusters.

At this point, the target becomes the primary cluster.

=== Phase 5: Connect directly to the target cluster

In this phase, move your client applications off the {product-proxy} and connect them directly to the target cluster.

Once this happens, the migration is complete, and you now exclusively use the target cluster.

[#lab]
== {product} interactive lab

As a companion to the {product-short} documentation, you can use the https://www.datastax.com/dev/zdm[{product} interactive lab] to try the entire migration process in a demo environment.

The lab only requires a GitHub account and a supported browser.
All browsers are supported except Safari.

You don't need to install anything because the lab uses a pre-configured GitPod environment.

This lab provides an interactive, detailed walkthrough of the migration process, including pre-migration preparation and each of the five migration phases.
The lab describes and demonstrates all steps and automation required to prepare for and complete a migration from any supported origin database to any supported target database.
