:page-tag: migration,zdm,zero-downtime,zdm-proxy,introduction

With {product}, your applications can continue to run while you migrate data from one {cass-short}-based cluster to another, resulting in little or no downtime and minimal service interruptions.

.Why migrate?
[%collapsible]
====
There are many reasons that you might need to migrate data and applications.
For example:

* You want to move to a different database provider.
For example, you might move from self-managed clusters to a cloud-based Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS), such as {astra-db}.

* You need to upgrade a cluster to a newer version or infrastructure.

* You want to move client applications from shared clusters to dedicated clusters for greater control over individual configurations.

* You want to consolidate client applications running on separate clusters onto one shared cluster to minimize sprawl and maintenance.
====

{product-short} is comprised of {product-proxy}, {product-utility}, and {product-automation}, which orchestrate activity-in-transition on your clusters.
To move and validate data, you use {sstable-sideloader}, {cass-migrator}, or {dsbulk-migrator}.
{product-proxy} keeps your clusters in sync at all times by a dual-write logic configuration, which means you can stop the migration or xref:rollback.adoc[roll back] at any point.
For more information about these tools, see xref:ROOT:components.adoc[].

When the migration is complete, the data is present in the new database, and you can update your client applications to connect exclusively to the new database.
The old database becomes obsolete and can be removed.

== Requirements for zero downtime

True zero downtime migration is only possible if your database meets the minimum requirements, including cluster compatibility, described in xref:ROOT:feasibility-checklists.adoc[]
If your database doesn't meet these requirements, you can still complete the migration, but downtime might be necessary to finish the migration.

For more information, see xref:ROOT:feasibility-checklists.adoc[]

== Migration phases

A migration project includes preparation for the migration and five migration phases.

The following sections describe the major events in each phase and how your client applications perform read and write operations on your origin and target clusters during each phase.

The _origin_ is is your existing {cass-short}-based environment, which can be {cass}, {dse-short}, or {astra-db}.
The _target_ is your new {cass-short}-based environment where you want to migrate your data and client applications.

=== Pre-migration client application operations

Here's a look at a pre-migration from a high-level view.
At this point, your client applications are performing read/write operations with an existing CQL-compatible database such as {cass}, {dse-short}, or {astra-db}.

[TIP]
====
For the migration to succeed, the origin and target clusters must have matching schemas.

A CQL statement that your client application sends to {product-proxy} must be able to succeed on both the origin and target clusters.

This means that any keyspace that your client application uses must exist on both the origin and target clusters with the same name.
The table names, column names, and data types must also match.
For more information, see xref:feasibility-checklists.adoc#_schemakeyspace_compatibility[Schema/keyspace compatibility].

=== Migration planning

Before you begin the migration, plan and prepare for the migration:

* xref:ROOT:feasibility-checklists.adoc[]
* xref:ROOT:deployment-infrastructure.adoc[]
* xref:ROOT:create-target.adoc[]
* xref:ROOT:rollback.adoc[]

=== Phase 1: Deploy {product-proxy} and connect client applications

In this first phase, deploy the {product-proxy} instances and connect client applications to the proxies.
This phase activates the dual-write logic.
Writes are bifurcated (sent to both the origin and target), while reads are executed on the origin only.

=== Phase 2: Migrate data

In this phase, migrate existing data using {sstable-sideloader}, {cass-migrator}, or {dsbulk-migrator}.
For information about these tools, see xref:ROOT:components.adoc[].

{product-proxy} will continue to perform dual writes while you move data and validate that the migrated data is correct.

=== Phase 3: Enable asynchronous dual reads

In this optional phase, you can enable the _asynchronous dual reads_ feature to test the target cluster's ability to handle a production workload before you permanently switch your applications to the target cluster at the end of the migration process.

When enabled, {product-proxy} sends asynchronous read requests to the secondary cluster in addition to the synchronous read requests that are sent to the primary cluster by default.

For more information, see xref:ROOT:enable-async-dual-reads.adoc[] and xref:ROOT:components.adoc#how_zdm_proxy_handles_reads_and_writes[How {product-proxy} handles reads and writes].

image:migration-phase3ra.png["Migration Phase 3."]

=== Phase 4: Route reads to the target cluster

In this phase, read routing on {product-proxy} is switched to the target cluster so that all reads are executed on the target.
Writes are still sent to both clusters.

At this point, the target becomes the primary cluster.

image:migration-phase4ra9.png["Migration Phase 4."]

=== Phase 5: Connect directly to the target cluster

In this phase, you move your client applications off {product-proxy} and connect them directly to the target cluster.

Once this happens, the migration is complete, and you now exclusively use the target cluster.

[#lab]
== {product} interactive lab

As a companion to the {product-short} documentation, you can use the https://www.datastax.com/dev/zdm[{product} interactive lab] to try the entire migration process in a demo environment.

The lab only requires a GitHub account and a supported browser.
All browsers are supported except Safari.

You don't need to install anything because the lab uses a pre-configured GitPod environment.

This lab provides an interactive, detailed walkthrough of the migration process, including pre-migration preparation and each of the five migration phases.
The lab describes and demonstrates all steps and automation required to prepare for and complete a migration from any supported origin database to any supported target database.
