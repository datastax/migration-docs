= Set up {product-automation} with {product-utility}
:page-tag: migration,zdm,zero-downtime,zdm-automation,zdm-proxy,ansible

This page explains how to use {product-utility} to set up the Ansible Control Host container for {product-automation}.

After completing the setup tasks in {product-utility}, see the xref:deploy-proxy-monitoring.adoc[next topic] for subsequent steps to use {product-automation}, which you will use to deploy {product-proxy} instances and the monitoring stack.

Once completed, you will have a working and fully monitored {product-proxy} deployment.

== Introduction

{product-automation} uses **Ansible**, which deploys and configures the {product-proxy} instances and monitoring stack via playbooks.
This step expects that the infrastructure has been already provisioned.
See xref:deployment-infrastructure.adoc[Deployment and infrastructure considerations], which include the infrastructure requirements.

To Configure a machine to serve as the Ansible Control Host, you can use {product-utility}.
This is a Golang (Go) executable program that runs anywhere.
This utility prompts you for a few configuration values, with helpful embedded explanations and error handling, then automatically creates the Ansible Control Host container ready for you to use.
From this container, you will be able to easily configure and run the {product-automation} Ansible playbooks.

== Prerequisites

. You must have already provisioned the {product-proxy} infrastructure, which means you must have the server machines ready, and know their IP addresses.
These can be in the cloud provider of your choice or on-premise.
. Docker needs to be installed on the machine that will be running the Ansible Control Host container.
For comprehensive installation instructions, see the https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/#server[Docker documentation].
. The `docker` command must not require superuser privileges.
The instructions to do this can be found https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user[here].

[NOTE]
====
The manual, non-superuser installation of Docker described above is to be done on the machine that will run the Ansible Control Host.
From that point, the automation will take care of installing Docker on the {product-proxy} machines without further intervention.
====

== Alternative Docker configurations

There are two options for users who don't want to pull from a specific registry or are not connecting servers directly to the internet.

Option 1: Pull through local cache::
Servers can connect directly to the Docker local registry so that the server then pulls containers from the internet itself.
See the https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/mirror/[Docker documentation] for instructions on how to set up a pull through cache.
This option makes it possible to only have the local Docker registry connected to the internet.

Option 2: Unconnected local registry::
Local registries not connected to the internet require administrators to manually add containers to their registry.
For {product-utility} users, this option requires the following five containers to install and configure the jumphost, {product-proxy}, and monitoring:

[source,no-highlight]
----
grafana/grafana:7.5.17
prom/prometheus:latest
datastax/zdm-ansible:2.x
prom/node-exporter:latest
datastax/zdm-proxy:2.x
----

== Jumphost

In this guide, we'll use a jumphost to run the Ansible Control Host container.

A jumphost is a server on a network used to access and manage devices in a separate security zone, providing a controlled means of access between them.
The jumphost can be, for example, a Linux server machine that is able to access the server machines that you wish to use for your {product-proxy} deployment.

The jumphost will serve three purposes:

* Accessing the {product-proxy} machines.
* Running the Ansible Control Host container, from which you can run {product-automation}.
* Running the {product-proxy} monitoring stack, which uses Prometheus and Grafana to expose the metrics of all the {product-proxy} instances in a preconfigured dashboard.

[TIP]
====
To simplify accessing the jumphost and {product-proxy} instances from your machine, create a xref:deployment-infrastructure.adoc#_connecting_to_the_zdm_infrastructure_from_an_external_machine[custom SSH configuration file].
The following steps will assume that this file exists.
====

Let's get started.

== Proxy deployment setup on the jumphost

To run {product-automation}, the Ansible Control Host needs to be able to connect to all other instances of the {product-proxy} deployment.
For this reason, it needs to have the SSH key required by those instances.

=== Add SSH keys to the jumphost

From your local machine, transfer (`scp`) the SSH private key for the {product-proxy} deployment to the jumphost.
Example:

[source,bash]
----
scp -F <path to zdm_ssh_config> <zdm key> jumphost:
----

Now connect to the jumphost.

[source,bash]
----
ssh -F <path to zdm_ssh_config> jumphost
----

== Run {product-utility}

. From the jumphost, download the latest {product-utility} executable from the {product-automation-repo}/releases[{product-automation} GitHub repository] {product-automation-shield}.
+
The package filename format is `zdm-util-**PLATFORM**-**VERSION**.tgz`.
The following example downloads {product-utility} version 2.3.0 for Linux amd64.
To download a different package, change the version and package filename accordingly.
+
[source,bash]
----
wget https://github.com/datastax/zdm-proxy-automation/releases/download/v2.3.0/zdm-util-linux-amd64-v2.3.0.tgz
----

. Extract the archive:
+
[source,bash]
----
tar -xvf zdm-util-linux-amd64-v2.3.0.tgz
----

. Run {product-utility}:
+
[source,bash]
----
./zdm-util-v2.3.0
----

The utility prompts you for a few configuration values, then creates and initializes the Ansible Control Host container.

[TIP]
====
{product-utility} will store the configuration that you provide into a file named `ansible_container_init_config` in the current directory.
If you run the utility again, it will detect the file  and ask you if you wish to use that configuration or discard it.
If the configuration is not fully valid, you will be prompted for the missing or invalid parameters only.

You can also pass a custom configuration file to {product-utility} with the optional command-line parameter `-utilConfigFile`.
For example:

[source,bash]
----
./zdm-util-v2.3.0 -utilConfigFile your_config_file
----
====

[NOTE]
====
{product-utility} will validate each variable that you enter.
In case of invalid variables, it will display specific messages to help you fix the problem.

You have five attempts to enter valid variables.
You can always run {product-utility} again, if necessary.
====

. Enter the path to, and name of, the SSH private key to access the proxy hosts:
+
[source,bash]
----
~/my-zdm-key
----

. Enter the common prefix of the private IP addresses of the proxy hosts:
+
[source,bash]
----
172.18.*
----

. You're asked if you have an existing Ansible inventory file.
If you do, and you transferred it to the jumphost, you can just specify it.
If you do not, product-utility} will create one based on your answers to prompts and save it.
Here we'll assume that you do not have one. Enter `n`.
+
The created file will be named `zdm_ansible_inventory` in your working directory.

. Next, indicate if this deployment is for local testing and evaluation (such as when you're creating a demo or just experimenting with {product-proxy}).
In this example, we'll enter `n` because this scenario is for a production deployment.
. Now enter at least three proxy private IP addresses for the machines that will run the {product-proxy} instances, for a production deployment.
(If we had indicated above that we're doing local testing in dev, only one proxy would have been required.)
Example values entered at the {product-utility} prompt, for production:
+
[source,bash]
----
172.18.10.137
172.18.11.88
172.18.12.191
----
+
To finish entering private IP addresses, simply press ENTER at the prompt.

. Optionally, when prompted, you can enter the private IP address of your Monitoring instance, which will use Prometheus to store data and Grafana to visualize it into a preconfigured dashboard.
It is strongly recommended to expose the {product-proxy} metrics in the preconfigured dashboard that ships with {product-automation} for easy monitoring.
You can skip this step if you haven't decided which machine to use for monitoring, or if you wish to use your own monitoring stack.
+
[NOTE]
====
We highly recommend that you configure a monitoring instance, unless you intend to use a monitoring stack that you already have.
For migrations that may run for multiple days, it is essential that you use metrics to understand the performance and health of the {product-proxy} instances.

You cannot rely solely on information in the logs.
They report connection or protocol errors, but do not give you enough information on how {product-proxy} is working and how each cluster is responding.
Metrics, however, provide especially helpful data and the graphs show you how they vary over time.
The monitoring stack ships with preconfigured Grafana dashboards that are automatically set up as part of the monitoring deployment.

For details about the metrics you can observe in these preconfigured Grafana dashboards, see xref:ROOT:metrics.adoc[].
====
+
You can choose to deploy the monitoring stack on the jumphost or on a different machine, as long as it can connect to the {product-proxy} instances over TCP on ports 9100 (to collect host-level metrics) and on the port on which {product-proxy} exposes its own metrics, typically 14001.
+
In this example, we'll enter the same IP of the Ansible control host (the jumphost machine on which we're running {product-utility}).
Example:
+
[source,bash]
----
172.18.100.128
----

At this point, {product-utility}:

* Has created the Ansible Inventory to the default file, `zdm_ansible_inventory`.
* Has written the {product-utility} configuration to the default file, `ansible_container_init_config`.
* Presents a summary of the configuration thus far, and prompts you to Continue.
Example:

image::zdm-go-utility-results3.png[A summary of the configuration provided is displayed in the terminal]

If you agree, enter `Y` to proceed.

{product-utility} now:

* Creates and downloads the image of the Ansible Docker container for you.
* Creates, configures and starts the Ansible Control Host container.
* Displays a message. Example:

image::zdm-go-utility-success3.png[Ansible Docker container success messages]

[NOTE]
====
Depending on your circumstances, you can make different choices in the {product-utility} configuration, which will result in a path that is slightly different to the one explained here.
The utility will guide you through the process with meaningful, self-explanatory messages and help you rectify any issue that you may encounter.

The successful outcome will always be a configured Ansible Control Host container ready to run {product-automation}.
