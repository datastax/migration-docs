= Phase 3: Enable asynchronous dual reads
:page-tag: migration,zdm,zero-downtime,zdm-proxy,async-reads

In this phase, you can optionally enable asynchronous dual reads.
The idea is to test performance and verify that the target cluster can handle your application's live request load before cutting over from the origin cluster to the target cluster.

//For illustrations of all the migration phases, see the xref:introduction.adoc#_migration_phases[Introduction].

[TIP]
====
As you test the performance on the target, be sure to examine the async read metrics.
As noted in the xref:#_validating_performance_and_error_rate[section] below, you can learn more in xref:metrics.adoc#_asynchronous_read_requests_metrics[Asynchronous read requests metrics].
====

== Steps

The steps consist of changing the `read_mode` configuration variable in `vars/zdm_proxy_core_config.yml` from `PRIMARY_ONLY` (the default) to `DUAL_ASYNC_ON_SECONDARY`. 

Example:

[source,yml]
----
read_mode: DUAL_ASYNC_ON_SECONDARY
----

Before making the change, you should still have the origin as the primary cluster, which is the default:

[source,yml]
----
primary_cluster: ORIGIN # or empty
----

To apply this change, run the `rolling_update_zdm_proxy.yml` playbook as explained xref:manage-proxy-instances.adoc#change-mutable-config-variable[here].

[NOTE]
====
This optional phase introduces an additional check to make sure that the target can handle the load without timeouts or unacceptable latencies.
You would typically perform this step once you have migrated all the existing data from the origin cluster and completed all validation checks and reconciliation, if necessary.
====

== Asynchronous Dual Reads mode

When using the {product-proxy}, all writes are synchronously sent to both the origin and target clusters.
Reads operate differently: with the default read mode, reads are only sent to the primary cluster (Origin by default).

In Phase 4, you will change the read routing so that reads are routed to the target.
Before you do this, you might want to temporarily send the reads to both clusters to make sure that the target can handle the full workload of reads and writes.

If you set the proxy's `read_mode` configuration variable to `DUAL_ASYNC_ON_SECONDARY`, then asynchronous dual reads will be enabled.
That change will result in reads being additionally sent to the secondary cluster.
The proxy will return the read response to the client application as soon as the primary cluster's response arrives.

The secondary cluster's response will only be used to track metrics.
There will be no impact to the client application if the read fails on the secondary cluster, or if the read performance on the secondary cluster is degraded.
Therefore, you can use this feature as a safer way to test the full workload on the target before setting the target as the primary cluster in Phase 4

[NOTE]
====
In some cases the additional read requests can cause the write requests to fail or timeout on that cluster.
This means that, while this feature provides a way to route read requests to the target with a lower chance of having impact on the client application, it doesn't completely eliminate that chance.

[[_validating_performance_and_error_rate]]
== Validating performance and error rate

Because the client application is not impacted by these asynchronous reads, the only way to measure the performance and error rate of these asynchronous reads are:

* Check the metrics of the cluster itself
* Check the asynchronous reads section of the {product-proxy} metrics

In the {product-proxy} Grafana dashboard that the {product-automation} is able to deploy, there is a section dedicated to asynchronous reads where you can see latency percentiles, error rates, and some other metrics specific to these requests. 

For more, see xref:metrics.adoc#_asynchronous_read_requests_metrics[Asynchronous read requests metrics].

== Reminder to switch off async dual reads

Once you are satisfied that your target cluster is ready and tuned appropriately to handle the production read load, you can switch your sync reads to the target permanently.
At this point, be sure to also disable async dual reads by reverting `read_mode` in `vars/zdm_proxy_core_config.yml` to `PRIMARY_ONLY`.
