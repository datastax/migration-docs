This topic explains how to use the Ansible automation playbooks that you set up in the xref:setup-ansible-playbooks.adoc[prior topic] to deploy the {zdm-proxy} and its monitoring stack.

Once completed, you will have a working and fully monitored {zdm-proxy} deployment.

== Prerequisites

You must have completed the Ansible setup as described in the xref:setup-ansible-playbooks.adoc[prior topic].

No other prerequisites or dependencies are needed. The playbooks will automatically install all the required software packages as part of their operation.

== Access the Ansible Control Host Docker container

You can connect to the Ansible Control Host Docker container by opening a shell on it:

[source,bash]
----
docker exec -it zdm-ansible-container bash
----

You're now connected to the container, at a prompt such as this:

[source,bash]
----
ubuntu@52772568517c:~$
----

You can `ls` to see the resources in the Ansible Control Host Docker container. The most important resource is the `zdm-proxy-automation`.

Now, `cd` into `zdm-proxy-automation/ansible` and `ls`. Example:

image::{imagesprefix}zdm-ansible-container-ls3.png[Contents of the Ansible Control Host container]

[[_configure_the_zdm_proxy]]
== Configure the {zdm-proxy}

The {zdm-proxy} configuration is composed of four files:

* `zdm_proxy_cluster_config.yml`, containing all the configuration that allows the proxy to connect to Origin and Target. This is always required.
* `zdm_proxy_core_config.yml`, containing important configuration that is commonly used and changed during the migration.
* `zdm_proxy_advanced_config.yml`, containing advanced configuration that may be required in some scenarios but can be usually left to its default values.
* `zdm_proxy_custom_tls_config.yml`, to configure TLS encryption if desired.

=== Cluster and core configuration

The next step is to edit the `zdm_proxy_cluster_config.yml` file in the Docker container.
You'll want to enter your Cassandra/DSE username, password, and other variables.

In the container shell, `cd` to `~/zdm-proxy-automation/ansible/vars` and edit `zdm_proxy_cluster_config.yml`.
The `vi` and `nano` text editors are available in the container.

[NOTE]
====
Starting in version 2.2.0 of the {zdm-automation}, we added the `zdm_proxy_cluster_config.yml` file to contain all the configuration variables for Origin and Target.
Prior to version 2.2.0, the variables were in the `zdm_proxy_core_config.yml` file.

If you are using an automation version up to and including 2.1.0, please use `zdm_proxy_core_config.yml` to configure access to your clusters.
====

There are two identical sets of variables to configure the {zdm-proxy} to connect to the cluster.
One set is for Origin and its variables are prefixed with `origin`, while the set of variables for Target uses the `target` prefix.
In the explanation below, `*` indicates any of these two prefixes as appropriate.

These two sections are very important and are always required.
Populate the appropriate variables in each section for the respective cluster, by uncommenting the variables and specifying their values as follows:

. Cluster credentials:
.. If it is a self-managed cluster, `*_username` and `*_password` must be valid credentials for it.
Leave blank if authentication is not enabled on the cluster.
.. If it is an Astra DB cluster, authentication is always enabled: `*_username` must be the Client ID and `*_password` the Client Secret of a valid Astra DB set of credentials with the `R/W User` role.
. Contact points and port (only relevant for self-managed clusters, leave unset for Astra clusters)
.. `*_contact points`: comma-separated list of IP addresses of the cluster's seed nodes.
.. `*_port`: port on which the cluster listens for client connections. Defaults to 9042.
. For Astra DB clusters, choose one of the following options and leave unset the other (leave both unset for self-managed clusters):
.. If you wish to manually provide the cluster's Secure Connect Bundle:
... Download it from the Astra Portal and place it on the jumphost
... Copy it to the container. Open a new shell on the jumphost, run `docker cp <your_scb.zip> zdm-ansible-container:/home/ubuntu`
... Specify its path in `*_astra_secure_connect_bundle_path`.
.. Otherwise, if you wish the automation to download the cluster's Secure Connect Bundle for you, just specify the two following variables:
... `*_astra_db_id`: the cluster's https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra/astra-db-vector/faqs.html#where-do-i-find-the-organization-id-database-id-or-region-id[database id].
... `*_astra_token`: the token field from a valid set of credentials for a `R/W User` Astra role (this is the long string that starts with `AstraCS:`).

Save the file and exit the editor.

Example of a completed `zdm_proxy_cluster_config.yml` file for a migration from a self-managed Origin to an Astra DB Target:

[source,yml]
----
##############################
#### ORIGIN CONFIGURATION ####
##############################

## Origin credentials
origin_username: "my_user"
origin_password: "my_password"

## Set the following two parameters only if Origin is a self-managed, non-Astra cluster
origin_contact_points: "191.100.20.135,191.100.21.43,191.100.22.18"
origin_port: 9042

##############################
#### TARGET CONFIGURATION ####
##############################

## Target credentials (partially redacted)
target_username: "dqhg...NndY"
target_password: "Yc+U_2.gu,9woy0w...9JpAZGt+CCn5"

## Set the following two parameters only if Target is an Astra cluster and you would like the automation to download the Secure Connect Bundle automatically
target_astra_db_id: "d425vx9e-f2...c871k"
target_astra_token: "AstraCS:dUTGnRs...jeiKoIqyw:01...29dfb7"

----

The other file you need to be aware of is `zdm_proxy_core_config.yml`.
This file contains some global variables that will be used in subsequent steps during the migration.
It is good to familiarize yourself with this file, although these configuration variables do not need changing at this time:

. `primary_cluster`: which cluster is going to be the primary source of truth.
This should be left set to its default value of `ORIGIN` at the start of the migration, and will be changed to `TARGET` after migrating all existing data.
. `read_mode`: leave to its default value of `PRIMARY_ONLY`.
See xref:enable-async-dual-reads.adoc[] for more information on this variable.
. `log_level`: leave to its default of `INFO`.

Leave all these variables to their defaults for now.

=== Enable TLS encryption (optional)

If you wish to enable TLS encryption between the client application and the {zdm-proxy}, or between the {zdm-proxy} and one (or both) self-managed clusters, you will need to specify some additional configuration.
To do so, please follow the steps on xref:tls.adoc[this page].

[[_advanced_configuration_optional]]
=== Advanced configuration (optional)

Here are some additional configuration variables that you may wish to review and change *at deployment time* in specific cases.
All these variables are located in `vars/zdm_proxy_advanced_config.yml`.

All advanced configuration variables not listed here are considered mutable and can be changed later if needed (changes can be easily applied to existing deployments in a rolling fashion using the relevant Ansible playbook, as explained later, see xref:manage-proxy-instances.adoc#change-mutable-config-variable[Change a mutable configuration variable]).

==== *Multi-datacenter clusters*

If Origin is a multi-datacenter cluster, you will need to specify the name of the datacenter that the {zdm-proxy} should consider local. To do this, set the property `origin_local_datacenter` to the datacenter name.
Likewise, for multi-datacenter Target clusters you will need to set `target_local_datacenter` appropriately.

These two variables are located in `vars/zdm_proxy_advanced_config.yml`.
Note that this is not relevant for multi-region Astra DB clusters, where this is handled through region-specific Secure Connect Bundles.

[[_ports]]
==== *Ports*

Each {zdm-proxy} instance listens on port 9042 by default, like a regular Cassandra cluster.
This can be overridden by setting `zdm_proxy_listen_port` to a different value.
This can be useful if the Origin nodes listen on a port that is not 9042 and you want to configure the {zdm-proxy} to listen on that same port to avoid changing the port in your client application configuration.

The {zdm-proxy} exposes metrics on port 14001 by default.
This port is used by Prometheus to scrape the application-level proxy metrics.
This can be changed by setting `metrics_port` to a different value if desired.

== Use Ansible to deploy the {zdm-proxy}

Now you can run the playbook that you've configured above.
From the shell connected to the container, ensure that you are in `/home/ubuntu/zdm-proxy-automation/ansible` and run:

[source,bash]
----
ansible-playbook deploy_zdm_proxy.yml -i zdm_ansible_inventory
----

That's it! A {zdm-proxy} container has been created on each proxy host.

[[_indications_of_success_on_origin_and_target_clusters]]
== Indications of success on Origin and Target clusters

The playbook will create one {zdm-proxy} instance for each proxy host listed in the inventory file.
It will indicate the operations that it is performing and print out any errors, or a success confirmation message at the end.

Confirm that the ZDM proxies are up and running by using one of the following options:

* Call the `liveness` and `readiness` HTTP endpoints for {zdm-proxy} instances.
* Check {zdm-proxy} instances via docker logs.

=== Call the `liveness` and `readiness` HTTP endpoints

ZDM metrics provide `/health/liveness` and `/health/readiness` HTTP endpoints, which you can call to determine the state of {zdm-proxy} instances.
It's often fine to simply submit the `readiness` check to return the proxy's state.

The format:

[source,bash]
----
http://<zdm proxy private ip>:<metrics port>/health/liveness
http://<zdm proxy private ip>:<metrics port>/health/readiness
----

Readiness expanded GET format:

[source,bash]
----
curl -G "http://{{ hostvars[inventory_hostname]['ansible_default_ipv4']['address'] }}:{{ metrics_port }}/health/readiness"
----

The default port for metrics collection is `14001`. 
Optionally, you may have overridden this port when you deployed the {zdm-proxy} specifying a custom, non-default port that was set by changing the value of the configuration variable `metrics_port`. 
See xref:deploy-proxy-monitoring.adoc#_ports[this section] for more information.

=== Check {zdm-proxy} instances via docker logs

After running the playbook, you can `ssh` into one of the servers where one of the deployed {zdm-proxy} instances is running.
You can do so from within the Ansible container, or directly from the jumphost machine:

[source,bash]
----
ssh <linux user>@<zdm proxy ip address>
----

Then, use the `docker logs` command to view the logs of this ZDM proxy instance.

[source,bash]

----

Also, you can check the status of the running Docker image.
Here's an example with {zdm-proxy} 2.1.0:

[source,bash]
----
ubuntu@ip-172-18-10-111:~$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                     COMMAND  CREATED      STATUS     PORTS   NAMES
02470bbc1338  datastax/zdm-proxy:2.1.x  "/main"  2 hours ago  Up 2 hours         zdm-proxy-container
----

If the {zdm-proxy} instances fail to start up due to mistakes in the configuration, you can simply rectify the incorrect configuration values and run the deployment playbook again.

[NOTE]
====
With the exception of the Origin and Target credentials and the `primary_cluster` variable, which can all be changed for existing deployments in a rolling fashion, all cluster connection configuration variables are considered immutable and can only be changed by recreating the deployment.

If you wish to change any of the cluster connection configuration variables (other than credentials and `primary_cluster`) on an existing deployment, you will need to re-run the `deploy_zdm_proxy.yml` playbook.
This playbook can be run as many times as necessary.

Please note that running the `deploy_zdm_proxy.yml` playbook will result in a brief window of unavailability of the whole {zdm-proxy} deployment while all the {zdm-proxy} instances are torn down and recreated.
====

[[_setting_up_the_monitoring_stack]]
== Setting up the Monitoring stack

The {zdm-automation} enables you to easily set up a self-contained monitoring stack that is preconfigured to collect metrics from your {zdm-proxy} instances and display them in ready-to-use Grafana dashboards.

The monitoring stack is deployed entirely on Docker.
It includes the following components, all deployed as Docker containers:

* Prometheus node exporter, which runs on each {zdm-proxy} host and makes OS- and host-level metrics available to Prometheus.
* Prometheus server, to collect metrics from the {zdm-proxy} process, its Golang runtime and the Prometheus node exporter.
* Grafana, to visualize all these metrics in three preconfigured dashboards (see xref:troubleshooting-tips.adoc#how-to-leverage-metrics[this section] of the troubleshooting tips for details).

After running the playbook described here, you will have a fully configured monitoring stack connected to your {zdm-proxy} deployment.

[NOTE]
====
There are no additional prerequisites or dependencies for this playbook to execute.
If it is not already present, Docker will automatically be installed by the playbook on your chosen monitoring server.
====

=== Connect to the Ansible Control Host

Make sure you are connected to the Ansible Control Host docker container.
As above, you can do so from the jumphost machine by running:

[source,bash]
----
docker exec -it zdm-ansible-container bash
----

You will see a prompt like:

[source,bash]
----
ubuntu@52772568517c:~$
----

=== Configure the Grafana credentials

Edit the file `zdm_monitoring_config.yml`, located in `zdm-proxy-automation/ansible/vars`:

* `grafana_admin_user`: leave unchanged (defaults to `admin`)
* `grafana_admin_password`: set to the password of your choice

=== Run the monitoring playbook

Ensure that you are in `/home/ubuntu/zdm-proxy-automation/ansible` and then run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
ansible-playbook deploy_zdm_monitoring.yml -i zdm_ansible_inventory
----

=== Check the Grafana dashboard

In a browser, open \http://<jumphost_public_ip>:3000

Login with:

* *username*: admin
* *password*: the password you configured

[TIP]
====
Details about the metrics you can observe are available in xref:troubleshooting-tips.adoc#how-to-leverage-metrics[this section] of the troubleshooting tips.
