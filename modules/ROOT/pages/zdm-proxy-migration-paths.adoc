= Cluster compatibility for {product}
:description: Learn which sources and targets are eligible for {product}.

True zero downtime migration is only possible if your database meets the minimum requirements described in xref:ROOT:feasibility-checklists.adoc[], including compatibility of the origin (source) and target (destination) clusters.

== Compatible origin and target clusters for migrations with zero downtime

include::ROOT:partial$migration-scenarios.adoc[]

[TIP]
====
You can use {product-short} to support major version upgrades for your current database platform, such as upgrades from {dse-short} 5.0 to {dse-short} 6.9.
Using {product-short} reduces the risk of data loss or corruption due to breaking changes between versions, provides a seamless rollback option, and streamlines the upgrade process, eliminating the need for interim upgrades and progressive manual reconfiguration.

== Incompatible clusters and migrations with some downtime

If you don't want to use {product-proxy} or your databases don't meet the zero-downtime requirements, you can still complete the migration, but some downtime might be necessary to finish the migration.

If your origin cluster is incompatible with {product-proxy}, {product-utility}, and {product-automation}, you might be able to use standalone xref:ROOT:components.adoc#data-migration-tools[data migration tools] such as {dsbulk-migrator} or a custom data migration script.
Make sure you transform or prepare the data to comply with the target cluster's schema.

For more complex migrations, such as RDBMS-to-NoSQL migrations, it is likely that your migration will require downtime for additional processing, such as extract, transform, and load (ETL) operations.
For example, see the data modeling and compatibility considerations for xref:6.9@dse:managing:operations/migrate-data.adoc[migrating to {dse-short}].

{company} recommends that you contact your {company} account representative or {support-url}[{company} Support] for guidance on incompatible or partially compatible migrations.
