Enterprises today want to reliably migrate mission-critical client applications and data to cloud environments with zero downtime or near zero downtime during the migration. 

A migration is a workflow that encompasses the lifecycle of uploading and importing your data to the selected databases. 
{company} has developed a set of thoroughly tested self-service tools to walk you through well-defined migration options:

* Zero Downtime Migration (ZDM) Proxy
* Cassandra Data Migrator
* DSBulk Loader
 
With these tools, you can move your application to {astra_db}, DSE, or Cassandra with no downtime and with minimal configuration changes.
Your clusters are kept in sync at all times by a dual-write logic configuration.
You can roll back at any point for complete peace of mind.

== Migration process and tools

{company} can migrate all data, however critical, with or without downtime from one application to our database. 
When migrating data, you begin with an application connected to a cluster. 
You run data and connect your own users to this application.
Reads and writes are moved (as necessary) from the application to the cluster.
After completing the migration, the data runs from your cluster to our database.
Our data migration process has several options to make the transition smooth. 

* *ZDM Proxy*: You can continue to run your current application and migrate data to the Origin database without any downtime. 
It's a process of moving your current data from your application to the {company}'s Origin cluster without stopping any connection to and from any cluster or application. 
The proxy helps to manage the activity in transition.
Your applications connect directly to the proxy instead of pointing to the database.
NOTE: We recommend using three ZDM Proxies for this option. 
* *Cassandra Data Migrator (CDM)*: This option migrates and validates data between Cassandra-compatible clusters. 
It supports migration at scale and ensures accuracy and efficiency during the process.
CDM allows for migration with zero downtime when used with the ZDM Proxy, and it can also be used for migrations with acceptable downtime. 
* *DSBulk Loader*: This option is loading and unloading CSV/JSON data and counting table rows. 
 DSBulk also allows for migration with zero downtime when used with the ZDM Proxy. It does not support data validation/reconciliation other than validating the final table counts.

These tools provide features that help you migrate your data from any Cassandra Origin (Apache CassandraÂ®, {company} Enterprise (DSE), {company} {astra_db}) to any Cassandra Target (Apache Cassandra, DSE, {company} {astra_db}).
