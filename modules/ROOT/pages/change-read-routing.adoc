= Phase 4: Route reads to the target

After you migrate and validate your data in xref:ROOT:migrate-and-validate-data.adoc[Phase 2], and then test your target cluster's production readiness in xref:ROOT:enable-async-dual-reads.adoc[Phase 3], you can configure {product-proxy} to route _all_ read requests to the target cluster instead of the origin cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This phase routes production read requests to the target cluster exclusively.
Make sure all data is present on the target cluster, and it is prepared to handle full-scale production workloads.

== Prerequisites

* Complete xref:ROOT:migrate-and-validate-data.adoc[Phase 2].

* Complete xref:ROOT:enable-async-dual-reads.adoc[Phase 3], and then disable asynchronous dual reads by setting `read_mode` to `PRIMARY_ONLY`.
+
If you don't disable asynchronous dual reads, {product-proxy} sends asynchronous, duplicate read requests to your origin cluster.
This is harmless but unnecessary.

== Changing the read routing configuration

Read routing is controlled by a mutable configuration variable.
For more information, see  xref:manage-proxy-instances.adoc#change-mutable-config-variable[Change a mutable configuration variable].

. Connect to your Ansible Control Host container.
+
For example, `ssh` into the jumphost:
+
[source,bash]
----
ssh -F ~/.ssh/zdm_ssh_config jumphost
----
+
Then, connect to the Ansible Control Host container:
+
[source,bash]
----
docker exec -it zdm-ansible-container bash
----
+
.Result
[%collapsible]
====
[source,bash]
----
ubuntu@52772568517c:~$
----
====

. Edit the {product-proxy} core configuration file: `vars/zdm_proxy_core_config.yml`.

. Change the `primary_cluster` variable to `TARGET`.

. Run the rolling restart playbook to apply the configuration change to your entire {product-proxy} deployment:
+
[source,bash]
----
ansible-playbook rolling_update_zdm_proxy.yml -i zdm_ansible_inventory
----

. Wait while Ansible restarts the {product-proxy} instances, one by one.

Once the instances are restarted, all reads are routed to the target cluster instead of the origin cluster.

At this point, the target cluster is considered the primary cluster, but {product-proxy} still keeps the origin cluster synchronized through dual writes.

== Verify the read routing change

Once the read routing configuration change has been rolled out, you might want to verify that reads are being sent to the target cluster as expected.
This isn't required, but it can provide confirmation that the change was applied successfully.

However, it is difficult to assess read routing because the purpose of {product-short} is to align the clusters and provide an invisible proxy layer between your client application and the database clusters.
By design, the data is expected to be identical on both clusters, and your client application has no awareness of which cluster is servicing its requests.

For this reason, the only way to manually test read routing is to intentionally write mismatched test data to the clusters.
Then, you can send a read request to {product-proxy} and see which cluster-specific data is returned, which indicates the cluster that received the read request.
There are two ways to do this.

[tabs]
======
Manually create mismatched tables::
+
--
To manually create mismatched data, you can create a test table on each cluster, and then write different data to each table.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When you write the mismatched data to the tables, make sure you connect to each cluster directly.
Don't connect to {product-proxy}, because {product-proxy} will, by design, write the same data to both clusters through dual writes.
====

. Create a small test table on both clusters, such as a simple key/value table.
You can use an existing keyspace, or create one for this test specifically.
For example:
+
[source,cql]
----
CREATE TABLE test_keyspace.test_table(k TEXT PRIMARY KEY, v TEXT);
----

. Use `cqlsh` to connect _directly to the origin cluster_, and then insert a row with any key and a value that is specific to the origin cluster.
For example:
+
[source,cql]
----
INSERT INTO test_keyspace.test_table(k, v) VALUES ('1', 'Hello from the origin cluster!');
----

. Use `cqlsh` to connect _directly to the target cluster_, and then insert a row with the same key and a value that is specific to the target cluster.
For example:
+
[source,cql]
----
INSERT INTO test_keyspace.test_table(k, v) VALUES ('1', 'Hello from the target cluster!');
----

. Use `cqlsh` to xref:connect-clients-to-proxy.adoc#_connecting_cqlsh_to_the_zdm_proxy[connect to {product-proxy}], and then issue a read request to your test table.
For example:
+
[source,cql]
----
SELECT * FROM test_keyspace.test_table WHERE k = '1';
----
+
The cluster-specific value in the response tells you which cluster received the read request.
For example:
+
* If the read request was correctly routed to the target cluster, the result from `test_table` contains `Hello from the target cluster!`.
* If the read request was incorrectly routed to the origin cluster, the result from `test_table` contains `Hello from the origin cluster!`.

. When you're done testing, drop the test tables from both clusters.
If you created dedicated test keyspaces, drop the keyspaces as well.

Use the Themis sample client application::
+
--
The xref:connect-clients-to-proxy.adoc#_themis_client[Themis sample client application] connects directly to the origin cluster, the target cluster, and {product-proxy}.
It inserts some test data in its own, dedicated table.
Then, you can view the results of reads from each source.
For more information, see the https://github.com/absurdfarce/themis/blob/main/README.md[Themis README].

======

=== System tables cannot validate read routing

Issuing a `DESCRIBE` command or read request to any system table through {product-proxy} cannot sufficiently validate read routing.

When {product-proxy} receives system reads, it intercepts them and always routes them to the origin, regardless of the `primary_cluster` variable.
In some cases, {product-proxy} partially populates these queries at the proxy level.

This means that system reads don't represent how {product-proxy} routes regular read requests.

Although `DESCRIBE` requests aren't system reads, they are also resolved differently than other `DESCRIBE` requests.
Don't use `DESCRIBE` requests to verify read routing behavior.

== Next steps

You can stay at this phase as long as you like.
{product-proxy} continues to perform dual writes to both clusters, keeping the origin and target clusters synchronized.

When you're ready to complete the migration and stop using your origin cluster, proceed to xref:ROOT:connect-clients-to-target.adoc[Phase 5] to disable dual writes and cut over to the target cluster exclusively.
