= Phase 5: Connect your client applications directly to the target
:navtitle: Phase 5: Connect client applications directly to the target
:page-tag: migration,zdm,zero-downtime,zdm-proxy,connect-apps,target

At this point in our migration phases, we've completed:

* Phase 1: Connected client applications to {product-proxy}, which included setting up Ansible playbooks with the {product-utility}, and deploying the {product-proxy} instances via the Docker container with {product-automation}.

* Phase 2: Migrated and validated our data with {cass-migrator} and/or {dsbulk-migrator}.

* Phase 3: Optionally enabled async data reads to check that the target cluster can handle the full production workload of read/write traffic.

* Phase 4: Changed read routing to the target cluster.

In Phase 5 you will configure your client applications to connect directly to the target cluster.
How you do this depends on whether your target cluster is {astra-db}, {cass-reg}, or {dse-short}.

//For illustrations of all the migration phases, see the xref:introduction.adoc#_migration_phases[Introduction].

== Configuring your driver to connect to a generic CQL cluster

If your target cluster is a generic CQL cluster, such as {cass-short} or {dse-short}, then you can connect your client application to it in a similar way as you previously connected it to the origin cluster, but with the appropriate contact points and any additional configuration that your target cluster may require.
For connection details, see the documentation for your driver language and version.

Make sure that your driver version is compatible with your target cluster.
For more information, see xref:datastax-drivers:compatibility:driver-matrix.adoc[].

== Configuring your driver to connect to {astra-db}

To connect to {astra-db}, you need the following:

* The xref:astra-db-serverless:administration:manage-application-tokens.adoc[application token] credentials that you used to xref:ROOT:connect-clients-to-proxy.adoc[connect your applications to the {product-proxy}].
+
As before, you can use either of the following sets of credentials to connect to your {astra-db} database:
+
** Token-only authentication: Set `username` to the literal string `token`, and set `password` to your {astra-db} application token.
** Client ID and secret authentication (legacy): Set `username` to the `clientId` generated with your application token, and then set `password` to the `secret` generated with your application token.

* Your {astra-db} database's {scb}.
+
The {scb-short} is a zip file that contains TLS encryption certificates and other metadata required to connect to your database.
Databases can have one or more {scb-short}s.
For more information, see xref:astra-db-serverless:databases:secure-connect-bundle.adoc[].
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The {scb-short} contains sensitive information that establishes a connection to your database, including key pairs and certificates.
Treat it as you would any other sensitive values, such as passwords or tokens.
====

* Recommended: A driver language and version that is compatible with {astra-db}.
For more information, see xref:datastax-drivers:compatibility:driver-matrix.adoc[].

If your client application uses an old version of a driver without built-in {scb-short} support, {company} strongly recommends upgrading to a compatible driver to simplify configuration and get the latest features and bug fixes.
However, you can still connect to {astra-db} for this migration by using https://github.com/datastax/cql-proxy[CQL Proxy] or extracting the {scb-short} archive and using the individual files to enable mTLS in your driver's configuration.

If your driver has built-in support for the {astra-db} {scb-short}, the changes to enable your application to connect to {astra-db} are minimal.

//Recalling the xref:connect-clients-to-proxy.adoc#_connecting_company_drivers_to_cassandra[pseudocode to enable your client application to connect to the proxy], here it is how your code needs to change to connect directly to {astra-db}:

The following pseudocode provides guidance on how you might change your driver's code to connect directly to {astra-db}:

[source]
----
// Create an object to represent a Cassandra cluster
// Note: there is no need to specify contact points when connecting to Astra DB.
// All connection information is implicitly passed in the SCB
Cluster my_cluster = Cluster.build_new_cluster(username="my_AstraDB_client_ID", password="my_AstraDB_client_secret", secure_connect_bundle="/path/to/scb.zip")

// Connect our Cluster object to our Cassandra cluster, returning a Session
Session my_session = my_cluster.connect()

// Execute a query, returning a ResultSet
ResultSet my_result_set = my_session.execute("select release_version from system.local")

// Retrieve the "release_version" column from the first row of our result set
String release_version = my_result_set.first_row().get_column("release_version")

// Close our Session and Cluster
my_session.close()
my_cluster.close()

// Display the release version to the user
print(release_version)
----

As noted before, this pseudocode is just a guideline to illustrate the changes that are needed.
For the specific syntax that applies to your driver, see the following documentation:
//TODO: Bring migration steps to this page instead of on the astra db pages where they don't seem to belong.

* https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-serverless/docs/connect/drivers/connect-cplusplus.html[C++ driver].

* https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-serverless/docs/connect/drivers/connect-csharp.html[C# driver].

* https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-serverless/docs/connect/drivers/connect-java.html[Java driver].

* https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-serverless/docs/connect/drivers/connect-nodejs.html[Node.js driver].

* https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-serverless/docs/connect/drivers/connect-python.html[Python driver].

Your client application is now able to connect directly to your {astra-db} database.

== Phase 5 of migration completed

Until this point, in case of any issues, you could have abandoned the migration and rolled back to connect directly to the origin cluster at any time.
From this point onward, the clusters will diverge, and the target cluster becomes the source of truth for your client applications and data.
