= Leverage metrics provided by {product-proxy}
:page-tag: migration,zdm,zero-downtime,metrics

This topic provides detailed information about the metrics captured by the {product-proxy} and explains how to interpret the metrics. 

== Benefits

The {product-proxy} gathers a large number of metrics, which allows you to gain deep insights into how it is operating with regard to its communication with client applications and clusters, as well as its request handling.

Having visibility on all aspects of the {product-proxy}'s behavior is extremely important in the context of a migration of critical client applications, and is a great help in building confidence in the process and troubleshooting any issues.
For this reason, we strongly encourage you to monitor the {product-proxy}, either by deploying the self-contained monitoring stack provided by the {product-automation} or by importing the pre-built Grafana dashboards in your own monitoring infrastructure.

== Retrieving the {product-proxy} metrics

{product-proxy} exposes an HTTP endpoint that returns metrics in the Prometheus format.  

{product-automation} can deploy Prometheus and Grafana, configuring them automatically, as explained xref:deploy-proxy-monitoring.adoc#_setting_up_the_monitoring_stack[here].
The Grafana dashboards are ready to go with metrics that are being scraped from the {product-proxy} instances.

If you already have a Grafana deployment then you can import the dashboards from the two {product-short} dashboard files from this {product-automation-repo}/tree/main/grafana-dashboards[{product-automation} GitHub location].

== Grafana dashboard for {product-proxy} metrics

There are three groups of metrics in this dashboard:

* Proxy level metrics
* Node level metrics
* Asynchronous read requests metrics

image::zdm-grafana-proxy-dashboard1.png[Grafana dashboard shows three categories of {product-short} metrics for the proxy.]

[#proxy-level-metrics]
=== Proxy-level metrics

* Latency
+
** Read Latency: Total latency measured by the {product-proxy} per read request, including post-processing, such as response aggregation.
This metric has two labels: `reads_origin` and `reads_target`.
The label that has data depends on which cluster is receiving the reads, which is the current xref:glossary.adoc#_primary_cluster[primary cluster].
** Write Latency: Total latency measured by the {product-proxy} per write request, including post-processing, such as response aggregation.
This metric is measured as the total latency across both clusters for a single xref:ROOT:components.adoc#how-zdm-proxy-handles-reads-and-writes[bifurcated write request].

* Throughput (same structure as the previous latency metrics):
** Read Throughput
** Write Throughput

* In-flight requests

* Number of client connections

* Prepared Statement cache:
** Cache Misses: meaning, a prepared statement was sent to the {product-proxy}, but it wasn't on its cache, so the proxy returned an `UNPREPARED` response to make the driver send the `PREPARE` request again.
** Number of cached prepared statements.

* Request Failure Rates: the number of request failures per interval.
You can set the interval in the `Error Rate interval` dashboard variable at the top.
** Connect Failure Rate: one `cluster` label with two settings, `origin` and `target`, which represent the cluster to which the connection attempt failed.
** Read Failure Rate: one `cluster` label with two settings, `origin` and `target`.
The label that contains data depends on which cluster is currently considered the primary, the same as the latency and throughput metrics explained above.
** Write Failure Rate: one `failed_on` label with three settings, `origin`, `target`, and `both`.
*** `failed_on=origin`: the write request failed on the origin only.
*** `failed_on=target`: the write request failed on the target only.
*** `failed_on=both`: the write request failed on both the origin and target clusters.

* Request Failure Counters: Number of total request failures (resets when the {product-proxy} instance is restarted)
** Connect Failure Counters: the same labels as the connect failure rate.
** Read Failure Counters: the same labels as the read failure rate.
** Write Failure Counters: the same labels as the write failure rate.

To see error metrics by error type, see the node-level error metrics on the next section.

[[_node_level_metrics]]
=== Node-level metrics

* Latency: Node-level latency metrics report combined read and write latency per cluster, not per request.
For latency by request type, see <<proxy-level-metrics>>.
+
** Origin: Latency, as measured by {product-proxy}, up to the point that it received a response from the origin connection.
** Target: latency, as measured by {product-proxy}, up to the point it received a response from the target connection.

* Throughput: same as node level latency metrics, reads and writes are mixed together.

* Number of connections per origin node and per target node.

* Number of Used Stream Ids:
** Tracks the total number of used xref:manage-proxy-instances.adoc#zdm_proxy_max_stream_ids[stream ids] ("request ids") per connection type (`Origin`, `Target`, and `Async`).

* Number of errors per error type per origin node and per target node.
Possible values for the `error` type label:
+
** `error=client_timeout`
** `error=read_failure`
** `error=read_timeout`
** `error=write_failure`
** `error=write_timeout`
** `error=overloaded`
** `error=unavailable`
** `error=unprepared`

[[_asynchronous_read_requests_metrics]]
=== Asynchronous read requests metrics

These metrics are only recorded if you xref:ROOT:enable-async-dual-reads.adoc[enable asynchronous dual reads].

These metrics track the following information for asynchronous read requests:

* Latency
* Throughput
* Number of dedicated connections per node for the cluster receiving the asynchronous read requests
* Number of errors per node, separated by error type

=== Insights via the {product-proxy} metrics

Some examples of problems manifesting on these metrics:

* Number of client connections close to 1000 per {product-proxy} instance: by default, {product-proxy} starts rejecting client connections after having accepted 1000 of them.
* Always increasing Prepared Statement cache metrics: both the **entries** and **misses** metrics.
* Error metrics depending on the error type: these need to be evaluated on a per-case basis.

== Go runtime metrics dashboard and system dashboard

This dashboard in Grafana is not as important as the {product-proxy} dashboard. However, it may be useful to troubleshoot performance issues.
Here you can see memory usage, Garbage Collection (GC) duration, open fds (file descriptors - useful to detect leaked connections), and the number of goroutines:

image::zdm-golang-dashboard.png[Golang metrics dashboard example is shown.]

Some examples of problem areas on these Go runtime metrics:

* An always increasing “open fds” metric.
* GC latencies in (or close to) the triple digits of milliseconds frequently.
* Always increasing memory usage.
* Always increasing number of goroutines.

The {product-short} monitoring stack also includes a system-level dashboard collected through the Prometheus Node Exporter.
This dashboard contains hardware and OS-level metrics for the host on which the proxy runs.
This can be useful to check the available resources and identify low-level bottlenecks or issues.
