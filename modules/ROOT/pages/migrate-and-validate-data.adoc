= Phase 2: Migrate and validate data
:page-tag: migration,zdm,zero-downtime,validate-data

In Phase 2 of {product}, you migrate data from the origin to the target, and then validate the migrated data.

image::migration-phase2ra.png[In {product-short} Phase 2, you migrate data from the origin cluster to the target cluster.]

//For illustrations of all the migration phases, see the xref:introduction.adoc#_migration_phases[Introduction].

To move and validate data, you can use a dedicated data migration tool, such as {sstable-sideloader}, {cass-migrator}, or {dsbulk-migrator}, or your can create your own custom data migration script.

// tag::migration-tool-summaries[]
== {sstable-sideloader}

{sstable-sideloader} is a service running in {astra-db} that directly imports data from snapshots of your existing {cass-short}-based cluster.
This tool is exclusively for migrations that move data to {astra-db}.

You can use {sstable-sideloader} alone or in the context of {product-short}.

For more information, see xref:sideloader:sideloader-zdm.adoc[].

== {cass-migrator}

You can use {cass-migrator} ({cass-migrator-short}) to migrate and validate tables between {cass-short}-based clusters.
It is best for migrating large amounts of data and for migrations that need support for detailed logging, data verification, table column renaming, and reconciliation.

{cass-migrator-short} offers extensive functionality and configuration options to support large and complex migrations as well as post-migration data validation.

You can use {cass-migrator-short} by itself, in the context of {product-short}, or for data validation after using another migration tool, such as {sstable-sideloader}.

For more information, see xref:ROOT:cassandra-data-migrator.adoc[].

== {dsbulk-migrator}

{dsbulk-migrator} is an extension of {dsbulk-loader}.
It is best for smaller migrations or migrations that don't require data validation during the migration process.

In addition to loading and unloading CSV and JSON data, you can use {dsbulk-migrator} to transfer data between databases.
It can read data from a table in your origin database, and then write that data to a table in your target database.

You can use {desbulk-migrator} alone or in the context of {product-short}.

For more information, see xref:ROOT:dsbulk-migrator.adoc[].

== Custom data migration processes

If you want to write your own custom data migration processes, you can use a tool like Apache Spark(TM).
