= Phase 2: Migrate and validate data
:page-tag: migration,zdm,zero-downtime,validate-data

In Phase 2 of data migration, you migrate data from the origin to the target, and then validate the migrated data.

//For illustrations of all the migration phases, see the xref:introduction.adoc#_migration_phases[Introduction].

There are three data migration tools that you can use during Phase 2 of your migration project:

* xref:ROOT:cassandra-data-migrator.adoc[**{cass-migrator} ({cass-migrator-short})**]: Best for migrating large amounts of data and for migrations that need support for detailed logging, data verification, table column renaming, and reconciliation.
+
{cass-migrator-short} offers extensive functionality and configuration options to support large and complex migrations as well as post-migration data validation.
For a complete list of features, see the https://github.com/datastax/cassandra-data-migrator[{cass-migrator} repository]

* xref:ROOT:dsbulk-migrator.adoc[**{dsbulk-migrator}**]: Extends {dsbulk-loader} with migration-specific commands. Best for small migrations and migrations that don't require support for data validation during the migration.

* xref:sideloader:sideloader-zdm.adoc[**{sstable-sideloader}**]: Exclusively for migrations from a {cass-reg}, {dse}, or {hcd} cluster to an {astra-db} database.
You can use {cass-migrator-short} to validate data after the migration.
