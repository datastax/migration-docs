= Migrate and validate data

In Phase 2 of {product}, you migrate data from the origin to the target, and then validate the migrated data.

image::migration-phase2ra.png[In {product-short} Phase 2, you migrate data from the origin cluster to the target cluster.]

To move and validate data, you can use a dedicated data migration tool, such as {sstable-sideloader}, {cass-migrator}, or {dsbulk-migrator}, or your can create your own custom data migration script.

//Migration tool summaries are also on ROOT:components.adoc.

== {sstable-sideloader}

{sstable-sideloader} is a service running in {astra-db} that imports data from snapshots of your existing {cass-reg}-based cluster.
This tool is exclusively for migrations that move data to {astra-db}.

You can use {sstable-sideloader} alone or with {product-proxy}.

For more information, see xref:sideloader:sideloader-zdm.adoc[].

== {cass-migrator}

You can use {cass-migrator} ({cass-migrator-short}) for data migration and validation between {cass-short}-based databases.
It offers extensive functionality and configuration options to support large and complex migrations as well as post-migration data validation.

You can use {cass-migrator-short} by itself, with {product-proxy}, or for data validation after using another data migration tool.

For more information, see xref:ROOT:cassandra-data-migrator.adoc[].

== {dsbulk-migrator}

{dsbulk-migrator} extends {dsbulk-loader} with migration-specific commands: `migrate-live`, `generate-script`, and `generate-ddl`.

It is best for smaller migrations or migrations that don't require extensive data validation, aside from post-migration row counts.

You can use {dsbulk-migrator} alone or with {product-proxy}.

For more information, see xref:ROOT:dsbulk-migrator.adoc[].

== Other data migration processes

Depending on your source and target databases, there might be other {product-short}-compatible data migration tools available, or you can write your own custom data migration processes with a tool like Apache Spark(TM).

To use a data migration tool with {product-proxy}, it must meet the following requirements:

* Built-in data validation functionality or compatibility with another data validation tool, such as {cass-migrator-short}.
This is crucial to a successful migration.

* Preserves the data model, including column names and data types, so that {product-proxy} can send the same read/write statements to both databases successfully.
+
Migrations that perform significant data transformations might not be compatible with {product-proxy}.
The impact of data transformations depends on your specific data model, database platforms, and the scale of your migration.
