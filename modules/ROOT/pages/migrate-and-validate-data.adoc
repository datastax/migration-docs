= Phase 2: Migrate and validate data
:page-tag: migration,zdm,zero-downtime,validate-data

In phase 2 of data migration, you migrate data from the origin to the target, and then validate the migrated data.

//For illustrations of all the migration phases, see the xref:introduction.adoc#_migration_phases[Introduction].

This topic introduces data migration tools that you can use during phase 2 of your migration project:

* {cass-migrator} ({cass-migrator-short}): Best for migrating large amounts of data and for migrations that need support for detailed logging, data verification, table column renaming, and reconciliation.

* {dsbulk-migrator}: Extends {dsbulk-loader} with migration-specific commands. Best for simple migration of smaller amounts of data quantities, and migrations that don't require support for data validation during the migration.

* {astra-db} {sstable-sideloader}: Exclusively for migrations from a {cass-reg}, {dse}, or {hcd} cluster to an {astra-db} database.
You can use {cass-migrator-short} to validate data after the migration.

== {cass-migrator} features

{cass-migrator-short} offers extensive functionality and configuration options to support large and complex migrations as well as post-migration data validation.

For more information, see xref:ROOT:cassandra-data-migrator.adoc[] and the https://github.com/datastax/cassandra-data-migrator[{cass-migrator} repository].

[[dsbulk-migrator-key-features]]
== {dsbulk-migrator} features

{dsbulk-migrator}, which is based on {dsbulk-loader}, is best for migrating smaller amounts of data or when you can shard data from table rows into more manageable quantities.

{dsbulk-migrator} provides the following commands:

* `migrate-live`: Start a live data migration using a the embedded version of {dsbulk-loader} or your own {dsbulk-loader} installation.
A live migration means that the data migration starts immediately and is performed by this migrator tool through the specified {dsbulk-loader} installation.

* `generate-script`: Generate a migration script that you can execute to perform a data migration with a your own {dsbulk-loader} installation.
This command _doesn't_ trigger the migration; it only generates the migration script that you must then execute.

* `generate-ddl`: Read the schema from origin, and then generate CQL files to recreate it in your target {astra-db} database.

For more information, see xref:ROOT:dsbulk-migrator.adoc[] and the https://github.com/datastax/dsbulk-migrator[{dsbulk-migrator} repository].

== {astra-db} {sstable-sideloader}

{sstable-sideloader} is a service running in {astra-db} that directly imports data from snapshot backups that you've uploaded to {astra-db} from an existing {cass-short}, {dse-short}, or {hcd-short} cluster.

Because it imports data directly, {sstable-sideloader} can offer several advantages over CQL-based tools like {dsbulk-migrator} and {cass-migrator}, including faster, more cost-effective data loading, and minimal performance impacts on your origin cluster and target database.

{sstable-sideloader} uses the {astra-db} {devops-api}, your cloud providers CLI, and `nodetool`.
