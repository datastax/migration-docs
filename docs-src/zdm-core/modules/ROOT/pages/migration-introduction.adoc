= Introduction to Zero Downtime Migrations

Enterprises today depend on the ability to reliably migrate their mission-critical apps and data to cloud environments with zero downtime during the migration.

At DataStax, we've developed a set of thoroughly-tested self-service tools, automation scripts, examples, and documented procedures that walk you through a set of well-defined migration phases. 

For example, to lower your total cost of ownership, you may want to migrate your on-premise Apache Cassandra&reg; or DataStax Enterprise (DSE) clusters, apps, and data to our cloud-native database, DataStax Astra DB.

We call this feature DataStax Zero Downtime Migration (ZDM). It provides the following functionality:

* You can move your application to Astra DB with no downtime and with minimal configuration changes
* Your clusters will be kept in sync at all times by a **dual-write logic** configuration
* You can easily rollback at any point, for complete peace of mind

== Migration scenarios

ZDM makes it possible to migrate your apps and data across many scenarios, including:

* From an existing self-managed Cassandra or DSE cluster to cloud-native Astra DB. For example, migrate:
** Cassandra 3.11.x or 4.0.x to Astra DB
** DSE 5.1.x or 6.8.x to Astra DB
** Astra DB Classic to Astra DB Serverless
* From an existing Cassandra or DSE cluster to another Cassandra or DSE cluster. For example, migrate:
** Cassandra 3.11.x to 4.0.x
** DSE 5.1.x to DSE 6.8.x

== Migration phases

Your migration project can occur through a sequence of phases, with zero downtime, as illustrated in this high-level view.

First, a few quick terms:

* The **origin** cluster is your existing Cassandra-based environment, whether it's open-source Apache Cassandra or DSE. 
* The **target** cluster is the new environment to which you want to migrate apps and data with zero downtime.

. Connecting your clients to the ZDM Proxy. This activates the dual-write logic: writes will be "bifurcated." Meaning, sent both to your Origin and Target clusters (cloud-native Astra DB, in this case), while reads will be executed on the Origin only.
. Migrating your existing data using the Database Migrator.
. Validating that the migrated data is correct, while continuing to perform dual writes.
. Switching the client app reads to the Target.
. Moving your clients off the ZDM-Proxy and connecting them directly to Target (in this case, Astra DB).

== Migration workflow

Here's a diagram to illustrate the overall migration strategy when moving apps and data from your origin to the target.

* With no changes required to your client app code itself, ZDM-Proxy does the work to route writes to your origin cluster and to the target Astra DB instance. 
* Database Migrator can migrate the data between clusters of any supported types. See the next section for an introduction to schema migration with the Database Migrator.
* Initially during the migration, ZDM-Proxy always reads from the origin cluster.
* Later during the migration, the read routing is switched to the target so that all reads are executed on it, while writes are still sent to both clusters. In other words, the target becomes the primary source of truth.
* Finally, the client can be moved off the proxy and connected directly to the target, at which point the migration is complete.

== Migration components

The primary component of the migration tool set is **ZDM-Proxy**, which by design is a simple and lightweight proxy that handles all the real-time requests generated by your apps. 

ZDM-Proxy itself doesn't have any capability to migrate data or knowledge that a migration may be ongoing, and it is not coupled to the migration process in any way. 

{company} {product} provides an Ansible-based automation tool. It allows you to deploy and manage the ZDM instances and its associated monitoring stack. There's an interactive utility that creates a Docker container acting as the Ansible Control Host, from which the Ansible playbooks can be run easily.

A separate process performs the work to migrate the existing data. The Database Migrator tool is an enhanced version of DataStax Bulk Loader (`dsbulk`). You can use Database Migrator to unload data from your Cassandra-based database into CSV or JSON files, and subsequently load the extracted data into the corresponding tables of the target database. Dual writes during the migration process ensure that your updates are sent to your existing origin database and simultaneously to your target database. 

Schema migration is also supported, with a preliminary step to verify that the schemas match between origin and target.  

=== Schema migration

For migration from the origin cluster to an **Astra DB target**, Database Migrator is able to:

* Connect to your origin cluster.
* Discover your user keyspaces - or the subset of keyspaces and tables that you want to migrate, if you specify them explicitly.
* Generate a set of Astra-friendly CQL DDL statements to create all these tables. This capability includes DDL for any User Defined Types (UDT). These CQL DDL statements are output to a file.

Your task for schema migration to an Astra DB target database will be to:

* Manually create the keyspaces from the Astra Portal, because keyspace creation through CQL is not supported on Astra DB.
* Take the generated CQL DDL file and run it either from the Astra Portal's CQL console, or from a standalone `cqlsh` client pointing to Astra DB.

Any secondary indexes, Storage-Attached Indexes (SAI), or Materialized Views that may have existed in the origin's schema are ignored, and must be dealt with manually by the user, in compliance with the Astra DB guidelines.

This schema preparation is a preliminary step that must be done before connecting your clients to the ZDM-Proxy. The goal is to ensure that database writes will not fail due to schema differences between origin and target.

For migrations to a target that is not an Astra DB, you can simply extract the schema definition from your Origin cluster via a CQL `DESCRIBE` statement, and then run that schema DDL on your target cluster. You may need to adapt the schema due to any differences in the features of the database software (such as compact storage).

=== Role of ZDM-Proxy

We created ZDM-Proxy to function between the application and the source cluster and Astra DB --  or any CQL-compatible data store -- so that every write operation (Insert, Update, Delete) is passed through to both clusters at the desired Consistency Level:

* If the write is successful in both clusters, it returns a successful acknowledgement to the client
* If the write fails on either cluster, the failure is passed back to the client so that it can retry it as appropriate, based on its own retry policy.  

This design allows for write consistency of new data to both clusters. ZDM-Proxy also passes through reads to the configured cluster (initially Origin, and later on Target) and returns the result to the application.

ZDM-Proxy is designed to be highly available. It can be scaled horizontally so typical deployments are made up of a minimum of 3 servers. ZDM-Proxy can be restarted in a rolling fashion, for example, to change configuration for different phases of the migration.

=== Key features of ZDM-Proxy

ZDM-Proxy:

* Allows you to lift-and-shift existing application code from the **origin cluster** to the **target cluster** with a simple change of a connection string.

* Reduces risks to upgrades and migrations by decoupling the origin from the target cluster, and allowing there to be an explicit cut-over point once you're satisfied with the target cluster.

* Bifurcates writes to both clusters during the migration process synchronously.

* Returns (for read operations) the response from a designated source of truth. During a migration, the origin cluster typically constitutes the source of truth. Near the end of the migration, you'll shift the source of truth for reads to be the target cluster.

* Can be configured to also read asynchronously from the target cluster. This capability is called **Read Mirroring** (also known as **Asynchronous Dual Reads**) and allows you to observe what read latencies and throughputs the target cluster can achieve without returning those results to the client. The asynchronous read from the target cluster is not sent back to the client. This design implies that failure on asynchronous reading from the target cluster does not cause an error on the client application. Asynchronous reads can be enabled and disabled dynamically with a rolling restart of the proxy instances. 

[NOTE]
====
When using Read Mirroring, any additional read load on the target cluster may impact the target cluster's ability to keep up with writes. This behavior is expected and desired. The idea is to mimic the full read and write load on the target cluster so there are no surprises during the last migration phase; that is, after cutting over completely to the target cluster.

== Benefits

When moving your apps &amp; data from on-premise Cassandra Query Language (CQL) based data stores (Apache Cassandra or DSE) to a cloud-native database (CNDB) like Astra DB, it's important to acknowledge the fundamental differences ahead. With "on-prem," of course, you have total control of the data center's physical infrastructure, software configurations, and your custom procedures. At the same time, with on-prem clusters you take on the cost of infrastructure resources, maintenance, operations, personnel. 

Ranging from large enterprises to small teams, IT managers, operators, and developers are realizing that the Total Cost of Ownership with cloud solutions is much lower than continuing to run on-prem physical data centers.

A CNDB like Astra DB is a different environment. Running on proven cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure, Astra DB greatly reduces complexity and increases convenience by surfacing a subset of configurable settings, providing a well-designed UI known as Astra Portal, and a set of APIs to interact programmatically with your Astra DB organizations and databases.
