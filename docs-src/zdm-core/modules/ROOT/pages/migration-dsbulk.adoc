= Loading data with DSBulk Migrator

You can use DSBulk Migrator to migrate tables between two clusters, leveraging the DataStax Bulk Loader (DSBulk) to perform the actual data migration.

The tool provides the following primary commands:

* `migrate-live` starts a live data migration using a pre-existing DSBulk installation, or alternatively, the embedded DSBulk version. A **live** migration means that the data migration will start immediately and will be performed by this migrator tool through the desired DSBulk installation.

* `generate-script` generates a migration script that, once executed, will perform the desired data migration, using a pre-existing DSBulk installation. Please note: this command does not actually migrate the data; it only generates the migration script.

* `generate-ddl` reads the schema from the origin cluster and generates CQL files to recreate it in the target cluster.
