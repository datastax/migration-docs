= Set up the Ansible automation with {zdm-utility}

This topic explains how to use the {zdm-utility} to set up the Ansible playbooks container. 

After completing the setup tasks in {zdm-utility}, see the xref:migration-deploy-proxy-monitoring.adoc[next topic] for subsequent steps to use {zdm-automation}, which runs the container to deploy {zdm-proxy} instances and the monitoring stack.

Once completed, you will have a working and fully monitored {zdm-proxy} deployment.

== Introduction

The ZDM automation uses **Ansible**, which deploys and configures the {zdm-proxy} instances and monitoring stack via playbooks. This step expects that the infrastructure has been already provisioned.  See xref:migration-deployment-infrastructure.adoc[Deployment considerations], which include the infrastructure requirements.

https://www.ansible.com/[Ansible] is a suite of software tools that enables infrastructure as code. It is open source and its capabilities include software provisioning, configuration management, and application deployment functionality.

The Ansible automation is organized into playbooks, each implementing a specific operation. The machine from which the playbooks are run is known as the Ansible Control Host. In ZDM, the Ansible Control Host will run as a Docker container.

Configuring a machine to serve as the Ansible Control Host is very easy using the {zdm-automation}. This is a Golang (Go) executable program that runs anywhere. This utility prompts you for a few configuration values, with helpful embedded explanations and error handling, then automatically creates the Ansible Control Host container ready for you to use. From this container, you will be able to easily configure and run the {zdm-automation} Ansible playbooks. It's migration made easy.

== Prerequisites

. You must have already provisioned the ZDM infrastructure; which means you must have the server machines ready, and know their IP addresses. These can be in the cloud provider of your choice or on-premise.
. Docker needs to be installed on the machine that will be used as the Ansible Control Host, and the `docker` command must not require superuser privileges. The instructions to do this are available for each platform in the official Docker documentation. (Alice's note: add links)

That's it!

== Jumphost

In this topic, we'll use a jumphost as our Ansible Control Host.

A jumphost is a server on a network used to access and manage devices in a separate security zone, providing a controlled means of access between them. The jumphost can be, for example, a Ubuntu server machine that is able to access the server machines that you wish to use for your {zdm-proxy} deployment.

The jumphost will serve three purposes:

* Accessing the {zdm-proxy} machines
* Serving as the Ansible Control Host to run the automation
* Running the ZDM monitoring stack, which uses Prometheus and Grafana to expose the metrics of all the ZDM proxies in a preconfigured dashboard.

[TODO this is about the monitoring -- move to later]
Having these tools set up is especially useful during migrations when you're running large workloads.

[TIP]
====
To simplify accessing the jumphost and {zdm-proxy} instances from your machine, create a custom SSH configuration file. 

TODO: Link to where we have SSH config example. 

// as explained xref:migration-deployment-infrastructure.adoc#create_zdm_ssh_config_file[here].

The following steps will assume that this file exists.
====

Let's get started.

== Proxy deployment setup on the jumphost

To run the automation, the Ansible Control Host needs to be able to connect to all other instances of the {zdm-proxy} deployment. For this reason, it needs to have the SSH key required by those instances.

=== Add SSH keys to the jumphost

From your local machine, transfer (`scp`) the SSH private key for the ZDM deployment to the jumphost. Example:

```bash
scp -F <path to zdm_ssh_config> <zdm key> jumphost:
```

Now connect to the jumphost.
```bash
ssh -F <path to zdm_ssh_config> <zdm key> jumphost
```

== Running the {zdm-utility}

From the jumphost, download the {zdm-utility}'s executable:
```bash
curl .... [TODO add exact command with download URL]
```

Run the {zdm-utility}:
```bash
go run main.go  [TODO add correct command once the executable has been created]
```

The utility prompts you for a few configuration values, then creates and initializes the Ansible Control Host container.
[TIP]
====
The {zdm-utility} will store the configuration that you provide into a file named `ansible_container_init_config`. If you run the utility again, it will detect the file  and ask you if you wish to use that configuration or discard it. If the configuration is not fully valid, you will be prompted for the missing or invalid parameters only.

You can also pass a custom configuration file to the utility with the optional command-line parameter `-utilConfigFile` [TODO add example command]
====

[NOTE]
====
The {zdm-utility} will validate each parameter that you enter. In case of invalid parameters, it will display specific messages to help you fix the problem.

You have five attempts to enter valid parameters. You can always run the {zdm-automation} again, if necessary.
====

. Enter the path to, and name, of the SSH private key to access the proxy hosts. Example:
+
```bash
/home/ubuntu/my-zdm-key
```
. Enter the common prefix of the private IP addresses of the proxy hosts. Example:
+
```bash
172.18.*
```
+
. You're asked if you have an existing Ansible inventory file. If you do, you can just specify it. If you do not, the {zdm-automation} will create one based on your answers to prompts and save it. Here we'll assume that you do not have one. Enter `n`.
+
The created file will be named `zdm_ansible_inventory` in your working directory.
. Next, indicate if this deployment is for local testing and evaluation (such as when you're creating a demo or just experimenting with the automation). In this example, we'll enter `n` because this scenario is for a production deployment.
. Now enter at least three proxy private IP addresses for the machines that will run the ZDM proxies, for a production deployment. (If we had indicated above that we're doing local testing in dev, only one proxy would have been required.) Example values entered at the {zdm-automation}'s prompt, for production:
+
```bash
172.18.10.137
172.18.11.88
172.18.12.191
```
+ To finish entering private IP addresses, simply press ENTER at the prompt.
. Optionally, when prompted, you can enter the private IP address of your Monitoring instance, which will use Prometheus to store data and Grafana to visualize it into a preconfigured dashboard. You can skip this step if you haven't decided which machine to use for monitoring, or if you wish to use your own monitoring stack.
+
In this example, we'll enter the same IP of the Ansible control host (the jumphost machine on which we're running this {zdm-automation}). Example:
+
```bash
172.18.100.128
```
+
At this point, the {zdm-utility}:
+
* Has created the Ansible Inventory to the default file, `zdm_ansible_inventory`.
* Has written the {zdm-proxy} configuration to the default file, `ansible_container_init_config`.
* Presents a summary of the results thus far, and prompts you to Continue. Example:
+
image:zdm-go-utility-results2.png[{zdm-automation} Inventory Results are displayed in the terminal]
[ TODO replace prompt image with one with updated names]
. If you agree, enter `Y` to proceed.

The automation now:

* Creates and downloads the image of the Ansible Docker container for you.
* Creates, configures and starts the Ansible Control Host container.
* Displays a message. Example:

image:zdm-go-utility-success.png[Ansible Docker container success messages]
[ TODO replace with updated message]
