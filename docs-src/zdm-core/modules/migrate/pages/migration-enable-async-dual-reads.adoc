= Enable asynchronous dual reads

Before cutting read operations over from Origin to Target, **optionally**, you could validate that the Target can handle read/write traffic by sending reads asynchronously to Target.

You would typically perform this optional step once you have migrated all the existing data from your Origin and completed all validation checks and reconciliation, if necessary.

== Start here

If you're not there already, `ssh` back into the jumphost:

```bash
ssh -F ~/.ssh/zdm_ssh_config jumphost
```

On the jumphost, connect to the Ansible Control Host container:
```bash
docker exec -it zdm-ansible-container bash
```
You will see a prompt like:
```bash
ubuntu@52772568517c:~$
```
