= Create the target environment for your migration

In this topic, we'll use a DataStax Astra DB serverless database as the Target cluster. However, you can choose a different target such as a more recent release of Cassandra 4.0.x or DSE 6.8.x.

== Overview

* Create an Astra DB serverless cluster
* Retrieve its Secure Connect Bundle (SCB) and upload it to the application instances
* Create Astra DB access credentials for the cluster
* Create the application schema

== Prerequisites

* Access to https://astra.datastax.com[Astra Portal, window="_blank"] on astra.datastax.com.

== Create an Astra DB serverless cluster

Log into the Astra console and create a Serverless Astra DB database. You can start with a Free plan, but consider upgrading during your migration project to an Astra DB Pay As You Go (PAYG) or Enterprise plan, to take advantage of additional functionality -- such as Exporting Metrics to external third-party apps, Bring Your Own Keys, and other features.

The PAYG and Enterprise plans have many benefits over the Free plan, such as the ability to lift rate limiting, and avoiding hibernation timeouts.

Assign your preferred values for the serverless database:

* **Name**
* **Keyspace** - this is a handle that establishes the database's context in subsequent DDL and DML statements
* **Cloud provider**: `AWS` is used in this guide's example; however you can choose your preferred cloud provider
* **Region**: choose your geographically preferred region - you can subsequently add more regions

When the Astra DB reaches **Active** status, perform the following steps in an Astra DB user account. Create an IAM token with the "Read/Write User" role. This role will be used by the application, the ZDM proxy, and the ZDM automation.

In Astra Portal, choose **Organization Settings** (upper left) from the drop-down menu, and then **Token Management**.  Select the **Read/Write User** role:

Then click **Generate Token**. Astra console displays the generated values. Example:

Save all credentials (Client ID, Client Secret, and Token) in a clearly named file. For example, you can save all three parts of the new credentials to a file called `my_app_readwrite_user` and store it safely.

For more information about role permissions, see link:https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra/docs/manage/org/user-permissions.html[User permissions] in the Astra DB documentation.

== Get the Secure Connect Bundle and upload to client instances

Your cluster's Secure Connect Bundle (SCB) will be needed by:

* Your application, to connect directly to Astra DB near the end of the migration
* Cassandra Data Migrator to migrate and validate data into Astra DB

// * The DataStax Bulk Migrator to import the existing data into Astra

With the Astra DB in an **Active** status, download its SCB from Astra Portal. It's a zip file that contains the security certificates and other metadata to connect to your database (note that the credentials are not contained in the SCB).

. In Astra Portal, go to the Dashboard and select the serverless database that you created in the prior step.
. Click on **Connect**
. Select the **Java driver** and click on **Download bundle**.
. Copy the SCB to your application instance:
+
```bash
scp -i <your_ssh_key> secure-connect-<target cluster name>.zip ubuntu@<public IP of application instance>:
```

== Create the application schema

Finally for the prep work on the migration target, create the application schema in your newly created Astra DB database. Make it identical to the schema on the origin cluster.

In Astra Portal, create each corresponding keyspace and one or more database tables, and (if any) indexes.

(**TODO**: introduce the application used as example, how to set it up, etc.)

In the sample scenario for these topics, we'll create the schema for the application that we are using:

. From Astra Portal, go to the **Dashboard** and select the database.
. Go to the **CQL console** tab.
. Create the `zdm_demo` keyspace if it does not yet exists.
. Create the following table:
```bash
create table zdm_demo.app_data (
    app_key int PRIMARY KEY,
    app_value text
);
```
