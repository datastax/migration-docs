= Introduction to {zdm-product}

Enterprises today depend on the ability to reliably migrate mission-critical client applications and data to cloud environments with zero downtime during the migration.

At {company}, we've developed a set of thoroughly-tested self-service tools, automation scripts, examples, and documented procedures that walk you through well-defined migration phases.

We call this product suite {company} {zdm-product} ({zdm-shortproduct}). 

{zdm-shortproduct} provides a simple and reliable way for you to migrate applications from any CQL-based cluster (https://cassandra.apache.org/_/index.html[Apache Cassandra&reg;^], https://www.datastax.com/products/datastax-enterprise[DataStax Enterprise (DSE)^], https://www.datastax.com/products/datastax-astra[{astra_db}^], or any type of CQL-based database) to any other CQL-based cluster, without any interruption of service to the client applications and data.

* You can move your application to {astra_db}, DSE, or Cassandra with no downtime and with minimal configuration changes.  
* Your clusters will be kept in sync at all times by a dual-write logic configuration.
* You can xref:rollback.adoc[rollback] at any point, for complete peace of mind.

[TIP]
====
The {zdm-product} process requires you to be able to perform rolling restarts of your client applications during the migration.

This is standard practice for client applications that are deployed over multiple instances and is a widely used approach to roll out releases and configuration changes.

== Migration phases

First, a couple of key terms used throughout the {zdm-product} documentation and software components:

* **Origin:** This cluster is your existing Cassandra-based environment, whether it's open-source Apache Cassandra, DSE, or {astra_db} Classic.

* **Target:** This cluster is the new environment to which you want to migrate client applications and data.

For additional terms, see the xref:glossary.adoc[glossary].

Your migration project occurs through a sequence of phases, which matches the structure of this ZDM documentation.

Before we walk through illustrations of each phase, let's look at a pre-migration, high-level view where your client applications are performing read/write operations with an existing CQL-compatible database. That is, Apache Cassandra, DSE, or Astra DB.

Before your migration begins, you'll need to satisfy prerequisites, prepare your environment, and set up the recommended infrastructure.

=== Phase 1: Set up Target, deploy ZDM Proxy, connect client applications

Let's look at Phase 1 of the migration. First, we set up the Target:

Then we deploy the ZDM Proxy instances and connect client applications to the proxies. This step activates the dual-write logic. Writes will be "bifurcated" (sent to both Origin and Target), while reads will be executed on Origin only.

=== Phase 2: Migrate data

In this phase, we migrate existing data using {cstar-data-migrator} and/or {dsbulk-migrator}. Validate that the migrated data is correct, while continuing to perform dual writes:

=== Phase 3: Async dual reads

In this phase, you can optionally enable asynchronous dual reads. The idea here is to test performance and verify that Target can handle your application live request load before cutting over:

=== Phase 4: Route reads to Target

In this phase, the read routing on the {zdm-proxy} is switched to Target so that all reads are executed on it, while writes are still sent to both clusters. In other words, Target becomes the primary cluster.

=== Phase 5: Connect directly to Target

In this phase, you'll move your client applications off the {zdm-proxy} and connect the apps directly to Target:

At this point, the migration is complete:
